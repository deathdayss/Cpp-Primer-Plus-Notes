<h3 id = "1"> C Programming Philosophy </h3>
*Top-down* design was another of the new principles. With C, the idea is to break a large
program into smaller, more manageable tasks. If one of these tasks is still too broad, you
divide it into yet smaller tasks. You continue with this process until the program is compartmentalized into small, easily programmed modules. C’s design facilitates this approach, encouraging you to develop program units called *functions* to represent individual task modules. As you may have noticed, the structured programming techniques reflect a procedural mind-set, thinking of a program in terms of the actions it performs.

<h3 id = "2"> The C++ Shift: Object-Oriented Programming </h3>
Unlike procedural programming, which emphasizes algorithms, OOP emphasizes the data.

<h3 id = "3"> C++ and Generic Programming </h3>
Generic programming is yet another programming paradigm supported by C++. It shares
with OOP the aim of making it simpler to reuse code and the technique of abstracting
general concepts. But whereas OOP emphasizes the data aspect of programming, generic programming emphasizes independence from a particular data type. Generic programming involves extending the language so that you can write a function for a generic (that is, an unspecified) type once and use it for a variety of actual types. C++ templates provide a mechanism for doing that.

<h3 id = "4"> Portability and Standards </h3>
If you can recompile the program without making *changes* and it runs without a
hitch, we say the program is *portable*.

There are a couple obstacles to portability, the first of which is hardware. A program
that is hardware specific is not likely to be portable. One that takes direct control of an
IBM PC video board, for example, speaks gibberish as far as, say, a Sun is concerned.

The second obstacle to portability is language divergence. Computer
languages, too, can develop dialects. Although most implementers would like to make
their versions of C++ compatible with others, it’s difficult to do so without a published
standard describing exactly how the language works. Therefore, the American National
Standards Institute (ANSI) created a committee in 1990 (ANSI X3J16) to develop a standard for C++. (ANSI had already developed a standard for C.) The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) soon joined the process with its own committee
(ISO-WG-21), creating a joint ANSI/ISO effort to develop the standard for C++.

<h3 id = "6">The Mechanics of Creating a Program</h3>
1. Use a text editor of some sort to write the program and save it in a file. This file
constitutes the *source code* for your program.
2. Compile the source code. This means running a program that translates the source
code to the internal language, called *machine language*, used by the host computer.
The file containing the translated program is the *object code* for your program.
3. Link the object code with additional code. For example, C++ programs normally
use *libraries. A* C++ library contains object code for a collection of computer routines,
called functions, to perform tasks such as displaying information onscreen or
calculating the square root of a number. Linking combines your object code with
object code for the functions you use and with some standard startup code to produce a runtime version of your program. The file containing this final product is
called the *executable code*.

<h3 id = "8"> Unix Compiling and Linking </h3>

You use the `CC` command to compile your program.The name is in uppercase letters to
distinguish it from the standard Unix C compiler `cc`. The `CC` compiler is a command-line
compiler, meaning you type compilation commands on the Unix command line.

For example, to compile the C++ source code file `spiffy.C`, you would type this
command at the Unix prompt:

`CC spiffy.C`

If, through skill, dedication, or luck, your program has no errors, the compiler generates
an object code file with an `o` extension. In this case, the compiler produces a file named
`spiffy.o`.

Next, the compiler automatically passes the object code file to the system linker, a program that combines your code with library code to produce the executable file. By
default, the executable file is called `a.out`. If you used just one source file, the linker also deletes the `spiffy.o` file because it’s no longer needed.To run the program, you just type the name of the executable file:

`a.out`

Note that if you compile a new program, the new `a.out` executable file replaces the
previous `a.out`. (That’s because executable files take a lot of space, so overwriting old executable files helps reduce storage demands.) But if you develop an executable program you want to keep, you just use the Unix `mv` command to change the name of the executable file.

In C++, as in C, you can spread a program over more than one file. (Many of the programs in this book in Chapters 8 through 16 do this.) In such a case, you can compile a program by listing all the files on the command line, like this:

`CC my.C precious.C`

If there are multiple source code files, the compiler does not delete the object code
files.That way, if you just change the my.C file, you can recompile the program with this
command:

`CC my.C precious.o`

This recompiles the `my.C` file and links it with the previously compiled `precious.o` file.
You might have to identify some libraries explicitly. For example, to access functions
defined in the math library, you may have to add the `-lm` flag to the command line:

`CC usingmath.C -lm`

<h3 id = "9"> Linux Compiling and Linking </h3>

Linux systems most commonly use `g++`, the GNU C++ compiler from the Free Software
Foundation.The compiler is included in most Linux distributions, but it may not always
be installed.The `g++` compiler works much like the standard Unix compiler. For example,
the following produces an executable file call `a.out`:

`g++ spiffy.cxx`

Some versions might require that you link in the C++ library:

`g++ spiffy.cxx -lg++`

To compile multiple source files, you just list them all in the command line:

`g++ my.cxx precious.cxx`

This produces an executable file called `a.out` and two object code files, `my.o` and
`precious.o`. If you subsequently modify just one of the source code files, say `my.cxx`, you can recompile by using `my.cxx` and the `precious.o`:

`g++ my.cxx precious.o`

<h3 id = "9">Windows Compilers</h3>

After you have the project set up, you have to compile and link your program.The IDE
typically gives you several choices, such as Compile, Build, Make, Build All, Link, Execute, Run, and Debug (but not necessarily all these choices in the same IDE!):

* *Compile* typically means compile the code in the file that is currently open.
*  *Build* or *Make* typically means compile the code for all the source code files in the
  project. This is often an incremental process. That is, if the project has three files, and you change just one, and then just that one is recompiled.
*  *Build* All typically means compile all the source code files from scratch.
*  As described earlier, Link means combine the compiled source code with the necessary library code.
*  *Run* or *Execute* means run the program. Typically, if you have not yet done the
  earlier steps, Run does them before trying to run a program.
*  Debug means run the program with the option of going through step-by-step.
*  A compiler may offer the option of *Debug* and *Release* versions. The former contains extra code that increases the program size, slows program execution, but enables detailed debugging features.
