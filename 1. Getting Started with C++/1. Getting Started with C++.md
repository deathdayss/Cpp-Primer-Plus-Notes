<h3 id = "1"> C Programming Philosophy </h3>
*Top-down* design was another of the new principles. With C, the idea is to break a large
program into smaller, more manageable tasks. If one of these tasks is still too broad, you
divide it into yet smaller tasks. You continue with this process until the program is compartmentalized into small, easily programmed modules. C’s design facilitates this approach, encouraging you to develop program units called *functions* to represent individual task modules. As you may have noticed, the structured programming techniques reflect a procedural mind-set, thinking of a program in terms of the actions it performs.

<h3 id = "2"> The C++ Shift: Object-Oriented Programming </h3>
Unlike procedural programming, which emphasizes algorithms, OOP emphasizes the data.

<h3 id = "3"> C++ and Generic Programming </h3>
Generic programming is yet another programming paradigm supported by C++. It shares
with OOP the aim of making it simpler to reuse code and the technique of abstracting
general concepts. But whereas OOP emphasizes the data aspect of programming, generic programming emphasizes independence from a particular data type. Generic programming involves extending the language so that you can write a function for a generic (that is, an unspecified) type once and use it for a variety of actual types. C++ templates provide a mechanism for doing that.

<h3 id = "4"> Portability and Standards </h3>
If you can recompile the program without making *changes* and it runs without a
hitch, we say the program is *portable*.

There are a couple obstacles to portability, the first of which is hardware. A program
that is hardware specific is not likely to be portable. One that takes direct control of an
IBM PC video board, for example, speaks gibberish as far as, say, a Sun is concerned.

The second obstacle to portability is language divergence. Computer
languages, too, can develop dialects. Although most implementers would like to make
their versions of C++ compatible with others, it’s difficult to do so without a published
standard describing exactly how the language works. Therefore, the American National
Standards Institute (ANSI) created a committee in 1990 (ANSI X3J16) to develop a standard for C++. (ANSI had already developed a standard for C.) The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) soon joined the process with its own committee
(ISO-WG-21), creating a joint ANSI/ISO effort to develop the standard for C++.

<h3 id = "6">The Mechanics of Creating a Program</h3>
1. Use a text editor of some sort to write the program and save it in a file. This file
constitutes the *source code* for your program.
2. Compile the source code. This means running a program that translates the source
code to the internal language, called *machine language*, used by the host computer.
The file containing the translated program is the *object code* for your program.
3. Link the object code with additional code. For example, C++ programs normally
use *libraries. A* C++ library contains object code for a collection of computer routines,
called functions, to perform tasks such as displaying information onscreen or
calculating the square root of a number. Linking combines your object code with
object code for the functions you use and with some standard startup code to produce a runtime version of your program. The file containing this final product is
called the *executable code*.
