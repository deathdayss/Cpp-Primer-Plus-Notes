```c++
#include <iostream>								// a PREPROCESSOR directive
int main()										// function header
{												// start of function body
	using namespace std;						// make definitions visible
	cout << "Come up and C++ me some time.";	// message
	cout << endl;								// start a new line
	cout << "You won’t regret it!" << endl;		// more output
	return 0;									// terminate main()
}												// end of function body
```

Some windowing environments run the program in a separate window and then automatically close the window when the program finishes. As discussed in Chapter 1, you can make the window stay open until you strike a key by adding the following line of code before the return statement:
`cin.get();`

For some programs you must add two of these lines to keep the window open until you
press a key. You’ll learn more about `cin.get`().

If you’re used to programming in C, seeing `cout` instead of the `printf()` function might
come as a minor shock. C++ can, in fact, use `printf()`, `scanf()`, and all the other standard C input and output functions, provided that you include the usual C `stdio.h` file. But this is a C++ book, so it uses C++’s input facilities, which improve in many ways upon the C versions.

You construct C++ programs from building blocks called functions. Typically, you
organize a program into major tasks and then design separate functions to handle those
tasks.
